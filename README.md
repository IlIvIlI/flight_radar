Little project for my degree



1. Choose values you want using avaliable scrolls (such as speed and etc.). Those properties will be applied to the next object that you create.
2. By pressing MB1 anywhere on map, it will save coords for the chosen point and it will be saved in a list. To clear the list, create new object.
3. To create new object, press key arrow_up.
4. To delete last created object, press key arrow_down.
5. Use MB1 on an object to select it. Then press MB3 (Right mouse click) to move that object manually.
